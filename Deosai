	<h4>Introduction</h4>

  <p>Deosai is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau">plataeu</a>, <em>one of the <span style ="color:blue">highest (2nd highest)</span> in the world, </em>located in Gilgit Baltistan, <strong>Northern Pakistan</strong>. It sits at an altitude of  4,114 metres (13,497 ft) above sea level and boasts an area of 3,000 kmÂ². 'Deo' means giant and 'Sai' means shadow, thus the name; The land of the giants. It has been believed for many hundreds of years that this place is haunted by giants. The place has an eerily deafening silence that when observed, can be unnerving and make you feel extremely lonely.  No civilisation has managed to make a settlement here as this is very difficult due to icy winds, thunderstorms, and the famous Deosai unpredictable weather. Sometimes it will be cloudy in summer or sometimes it will be snowing or it might be overcast, the weather here truly has a mind of its own. For 8 out of 12 months, Deosai is covered in snow and for the remaining 12 months, it is lush green. As a result of this, the area is still uninhabited even in this age. Though no one lives here, people apart from tourists do pass through here. Nomads have picked Deosai as their path of choice, for centuries they have passed through here with a herd. It's an area relatively unexplored by foreign tourists, so it is very much a <strong>hidden gem</strong> for tourists in that regard. Wildflowers bright in colour cover the landscape of Deosai and make the surroundings sradiate. It is home to the infamous brown bear and many other forms of wildlife.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deosai_National_Park" target="_blank">(More info)</a></p>

  <h3>Getting to Deosai</h3>
  <p>It is unfortunately not accessible all year round and can be only explored during August. Visiting during other months can be very strenuous and difficult journey. However, if you do manage to make it to Deosai you would be treated to a view that not many people have seen, as winter in Deosai is spectacular to witness. One should try to leave around 7am from Skardu in order to reach Deosai at 11am, and aim to be back at Skardu by around 9pm. If it's raining, then avoid going to Deosai that day since there is a very high chance if landsliding and you could be stuck there for a few days. Deosai is accessible from Skardu District in the north, Galtari Kharmang District in the south-east, and the Astore District in the west. Deosai is situated approximately 30km from Skardu city and this is the shortest route one can take in order to visit the place. From Sadpara Skardu, it will take a traveller approximately 1 hour to reach Deosai. There are many other various routes available to access Deosai, one only needs to ask the locals.</p>

	<br/>
	
	<p>It must be noted that the Himalayan Brown bear is critically endangered in this part of the world (Himalayan region) except for Deosai. This is as a result of habitat loss, fragmentation, slow reproduction rate, but the <em>main</em> reason is <strong>poaching</strong>. Bears are not usually a rare sighting so as a result of this you could have to explore the area quite a lot via jeep before you can catch a glimpse of these beautiful animals. Deosai national park was designed with the primary objective of conserving the brown bear and it is fair to say that it has met this objective because usually, the population sizes of these bears do not exceed 20, however, in Deosai this number is 72. From the list above, perhaps the rarest animal to see would be the snow leopard. It is extremely hard to catch a glimpse of these majestic animals as they like to live in recluse. Golden marmots are fairly common to see in the right season and where you would see a golden marmot, a red fox would not be far behind as they like to hunt for golden marmots.</p>

<div id="why Deosai stands out from the rest">


<h3>Why Deosai Stands Out From The Rest</h3>

  <p>There are many other sites in the western Himalaya region, of the World Heritage standard. These include alpine meadows such as Nanda Devi and Valley of National Park(both in India). Both these sites recognized for their diverse alpine flora representation of the West Himalaya geographical zone. Another site is the Great Himalayan National Park (also located in India), known for its mountainous environment with high latitudinal variation (unlike Deosai). All these could arguably be seen as an alternative to Deosai as they are all beautiful and amazing in their own ways. 
	
	<br/><br/>
	But what makes Deosai stand out from the rest is that none can match diversity, it's high altitude wetland environment and it's efforts to preserve the Himalayan Brown Bear in its natural habitat. Another thing that makes Deosai stand out is the fact that is surrounded by strikingly beautiful places such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimarg" target="_blank"> Minimarg</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skardu_Valley" target="_blank">Skardu Valley</a>. One can get lost in time exploring these enhcanting places.<br/>

    <h3>Things To See In Deosai<h3>

    <h4>Bara Pani</h4>
    	
    <p>As the name suggests (big water), this is a river nearly in the middle of Deosai. There are two bridges that go over it. One is a bridge made of concrete foundations and wood throughout, whilst the other is made of rope mostly and a few pieces of wooden planks here and there. Many tourists go on the rope bridge, though this is very dangerous since there are large gaps and you can easily lose your footing. This is a great spot for taking photos with families and friends.</p>

    <h4>Sheosar Lake</h4>
            
    <p>Sheosar Lake is a remarkable sight to behold. It looks like a flat bowl high among the mountains on a plains. The water is still and looks very serene. Often, this area is very windy and this fact is enjoyed by many of the people who visit here. From here you can catch a glimpse of the famous killer mountain; Nanga Parbat, and this view looks particularly cool in the winter, as shown in the picture at the top of the page.</p>

    <h4>Glacial Mountains</h4>

    <p>If you love adventure, then you will love the eipc backdrop Deosai provides; the snow-capped mountains, glaciers and fresh spring water. The wildlife, flowers, climate, grassland and serenity of the plateau combined with the surrounding mountains, glittering glaciers and crytal clear watercourses make this place a feel and look like heaven on Earth.</p>
